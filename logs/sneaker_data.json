The revolutionary design of Tinker Hatfield took over the footwear industry in a way nobody could have predicted. With an architectural background, Hatfield designed the sneaker with a visible air bubble, which was highly criticized as it was considered too innovative and eccentric. Luckily, Nike believed in innovative thinking and from there on the rest is history. The '86 OG silhouette features a white mesh base with grey suede overlays around the lacing system and heel. The guard is constructed with intense 'University Red' suede together with the Swoosh. The branding elements on the heel tab and tongue tag also come written in the same red hue as well as the insole and upper eyestays. A white midsole supports the upper while the outsole is constructed of a mix of white red and black patches. The element that makes this shoe truly authentic is the enlarged air bubble which at the time was a manufacturing mistake, thus the newer models feature a significantly smaller one.The colorway also comes in WMNS and GS Sizing.\u00a0"

The carabiner is often used in climbing. This striking detail also lends its name to the pack. This pack also contains another Nike Air Force 1 in a different colour version.Besides the striking Swoosh, this Nike Air Force 1 'Carbiner Pack' comes in a colour mix of white, black and red. The base is predominantly white and the tongue, insole, underlying Swoosh heel are done in black. The tongue label and carabiner are in red. The lace dubrae's have an orange metallic finish.\u00a0The nice thing about this Nike Air Force 1 is that you can give the sneaker two different looks. You can also detach the carabiner from the shoe. One pair, two different looks! But that is not all, because this Nike Air Force 1 'Carbiner Pack' has a second unique detail. That is the zippered pocket in the tongue of both sneakers. Good for storing something small. \u00a0"

The revolutionary design of Tinker Hatfield took over the footwear industry in a way nobody could have predicted. With an architectural background, Hatfield designed the sneaker with a visible air bubble, which was highly criticized as it was considered too innovative and eccentric. Luckily, Nike believed in innovative thinking and from there on the rest is history.The '86 OG silhouette features a white mesh base with grey suede overlays around the lacing system and heel. The guard is constructed with intense 'University Red' suede together with the Swoosh. The branding elements on the heel tab and tongue tag also come written in the same red hue as well as the insole and upper eyestays. A white midsole supports the upper while the outsole is constructed of a mix of white red and black patches. The element that makes this shoe truly authentic is the enlarged air bubble which at the time was a manufacturing mistake, thus the newer models feature a significantly smaller one.The colorway also comes in mens and GS Sizing."

The transformation extends from the flat leather panels to the fuzzy collar lining and ballistic mesh tongue construction, giving it a fresh and lively appearance.Notably, the tie-dye treatment is not limited to the surface. It also decorates the Jewel mid-foot Swooshes and the heel tab logo, both of which appear upside-down for a unique and eye-catching effect."

            "In an attempt to breathe new life into the Air Force 1 silhouette, Nike came up with the idea of the 'Colour of the Month'. This was a huge success and years later, the Air Force 1 has become a true icon for the sneaker community. So it is no surprise that the concept has been brought back in 2023 on the 40th anniversary of the silhouette. The 'White Snakeskin' features an all-white colour palette with different textures. Snakeskin leather overlays extend from the swoosh to the heel. Nike Air branding can be found on the tongue and heel, and the signature metal AF1 branding can be found at the bottom of the laces."

The upper of this model is made of mesh. The entire upper consists of different shades of blue. The heel has been given a light cream colour and the rest of the midsole is in white. To complete the model, the outsole has been given the same blue colour as the upper.The beauty of this special technology is that it makes it easier for people with a disability to put shoes on. The successful formula has been used before on the Air Jordan 1, Air Max 90 and the Converse Chuck Taylor."

The gradient effect gives it depth and dimension.The sneaker features a functional lace-up closure, padded collar, and cushioned insole for maximum comfort and support. Durability and excellent traction are both guaranteed by the rubber outsole. Nike's attention to detail is demonstrated by discrete branding elements on the sides and the Nike Air branding on the tongue and heel tab.The versatile Air Force 1 '07 LV8 PS 'Split Light Photo Blue' adds a splash of colour and style to any look. The sneaker is also available in men's, GS and TD size ranges.\u00a0"

Accessorised with a smooth light grey leather mudguard, the silver Swoosh with a cut belly is featured on the lateral. On the tongue and insole, the Air Max logo is presented in a mix of white red and black while the one on the TPU is completely white, blending into the design. Red mini Swooshes can be seen all throughout the shoe, on the lateral, heel tab and Air Bubble, giving a sparkle of colour to the tonal design. The midsole of the model features a smooth light grey foam on the front foot preceded by a white outsole. The back of the design is covered in a textile and presents the transparent Airbubble atop a semi-translucent silver outsole. The design of the sneaker has a very clean look due to its light grey upper accompanied by coloured details. An identical design in an all white upper is the 'Phantom' colorway."

The unique and eye-catching design mixes sustainable materials with a construction intended for comfort. Inspired by the peace and meditation found in Zen gardens, a sand-rake pattern on the midsole inspires calm, the bootie-like upper hugs the foot, and the Flyknit material used in the upper applies both venting and comfort.\u00a0The \u2018Enigma Stone\u2019 utilises a rather intense colorway with a marbled neon green pattern on the midfoot separating a brown and stone upper from a gum sole.\u00a0The model also comes in a \u2018Light Bone\u2019 colorway."

The overlays on the upper are double, just like the Swoosh. Also the sole is extra thick compared to the original silhouette. The overlays and the Swoosh have a black colour. The layers under the upper have a slightly lighter shade, making it look just like shadow. The rest of the sneaker is in white."

The Nike Air Force High was the first product to steal the show and gain instant recognition among athletes. It was initially marketed with the slogan \"Air in the Box.\"Sneakers, such as the Air Force 1, moved from the court to the streets in the 2000s and were adopted as official symbols of urban street style by the hip-hop community. As a result of these transitions, the models for toddlers, such as the \"Grey Red\" colourway, began to appear in a variety of new colourways.\u00a0The AF1 BT 'Grey Red' has a bright reddish tone as a contrast to the grey in the heel padding, the swoosh, the tag, and the outsole. Finally, to complement the upper tonalities, the sneaker has a white midsole. The Air Force 1 BG and Air Force 1 BP are also available in this colourway."

The \u2018Light Bone Khaki\u2019 colorway, the newest addition to the WMNS line, is ideal for the summertime. This Nike shoe, which was initially created in 1996, combines khaki and light bone tones.\u00a0The majority of its upper is made of lighter-colored leather, but there are also noticeable brown accents on the \u2018Nike\u2019 branding, inner lining, and Swoosh design. The midsole of the shoe, which is white, supports it and harmoniously displays the 180-degree Air Max units. Notably, the underfoot pattern showcases a speckled gum medium brown to honor Nike's commitment to sustainability through Nike Grind."

At first glance, it looks like a simple shoe, but when you scrutinise it, you quickly find out that it is no ordinary sneaker.The Nike Air Force 1 '07 SE WMNS 'Swoosh Pocket' has a smooth leather upper in the colour white. The white base has a textured 'photon dust' overlay, adding depth to the sneaker's design. The 'Team Red' colour gives the sneaker a strong look. This is reflected on several details of the design, including the Swoosh, heel, tongue and the \"Air\" text on the midsole. The swoosh features a so-called pocket where you can keep your special edition hangtag inside. To complete the elegant look, the sneaker has gold dubraes.The Nike Blazer Mid 77 Swoosh Pocket also released in February 2023."

To increase fan excitement, the slide was initially accompanied by a Clog-like structure. However, as fall approaches, the popular Calm Slide flip-flop model is now available in a 'Rugged Orange' colourway.\u00a0This new design departs from the summer-appropriate colour options with a rich Mars clay tint that pervades the entire piece. The monochromatic treatment, which extends from the serrated outsole to the protruding forefoot bridge, is what gives the 'Rugged Orange' version its distinct appearance. Given the popularity of monochromatic treatments, this new release is expected to be in high demand and may sell out quickly."

Originally promoted with the slogan 'Air in the box,' it was the Nike Air Force High that initially stole the spotlight and gained instant acclaim among athletes.In the 2000s, sneakers, including the Air Force 1, transitioned from the court to the streets, embraced by the hip-hop scene as official urban street style icons. With these transitions, many new colourways started to come afloat, including the children\u2019s models, such as the \u2018Grey Red\u2019 colourway.With a predominantly grey upper, the AF1 BP \u2018Grey Red\u2019 has a bright reddish tone as a contrast to the grey in the heel padding, the swoosh, the tag and the outsole. Finally, the sneaker has a white midsole to complement the upper tonalities. This colourway is also available on the Air Force 1 BG and the Air Force 1 BT."

This colorway is white from head to toe. This makes it the ideal sneaker to combine with different outfits.\u00a0The sneaker has a leather upper. The nose has perforation holes that help the shoe to breathe. On the middle panel is the Swoosh and on the strap over the heel is the Swoosh stitched. The Mid '07 has \"Air\" emblazoned on the midsole. Also on the heel is the Nike logo stitched in white.\u00a0"

Almost the entire upper is in white. Because of the simple colour scheme the sneaker fits with a lot of different outfits. On the Swoosh is a light pink colour. This soft tint comes back on the other Nike branding and on the outsole. The midsole and cassette are also in white."

The Nike Court Vision Low - Next Nature is a sustainable upgrade on an absolute classic model, with a plush, low-cut collar for maximum comfort, and a white colorway giving it a clean look. The stitched overlays, black Swoosh, and retro basketball style round off the sneaker nicely."
